        The author allows the following modifications:
        - You may change the color of any "texturename.blend.tga/.jpg" or hue
          to fit the style of your map.
             
        The author granted Unvanquished Development to make derivate works of
        his textures.

    Notes

        - Glow maps now end in "_a.*" instead of ".blend.*".
        - "*_p.*" files are preview images generated from the diffuse maps.

    Changes

        - Glow maps have been desaturated and put into grayscale mode.
        - Completely white alpha channels were removed.
        - File formats may have been converted.
